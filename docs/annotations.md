# Annotations

Annotations are used to add metadata directly to Java code to describe it.
Such metadata is read out by the Java compiler at compile-time to provide checks or
change/extend the default behaviour of the compiler, or by a Framework at runtime
to provide further automation in the background to reduce boilerplate code.

You can find a sample in [the code](../src/main/java/de/samples/annotations).
